# Frontend Mentor

Frontend Mentor is a website with plenty challenges to test your Frontend Skills. It allows you to use any framework you'd like or even the vanilla JS & CSS. Here i submit all the challenges i do in order, so i can notice how i'm progressivly evolving my skills. I'm also gonna start learning React and Tailwind CSS to use on these projects and finally get my hands on some frameworks!

PS: Each challenge has its own desktop and mobile design, i always use the mobile-first workflow, but not all of them has a smooth transition between these two versions. I recently began using responsive designs so the transition of both of them don't look so hard and rigid.

PS: Since the 14th challenge i started using Tailwind CSS, so fully responsive webpages begins there.

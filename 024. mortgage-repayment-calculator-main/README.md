- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Fonts Library

### Continued development

I decided to build this webpage using Next and TailwindCSS, mostly because i miss using TailwindCSS in projects and my React knowledge was getting rubbish, gotta say that i really don't miss React, not even with this framework. Personally i think that Angular is VERY better than React, even after some months of experience working deep on this IT market.
